# Music-Recommendation-System
In	this	project,	we	have	designed,	implemented	and	analyzed	a song	recommendation	
system.	We	used Song	Dataset to	 find	correlations	between	users	and	songs	and	 to	
learn	 from	 the	 previous	listening	 history	 of	 users	 to	 provide	 recommendations	 for	
songs	 which	 users	 would	 prefer	 to	 listen	 most.
